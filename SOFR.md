LIBOR vs SOFR
=============

LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) and SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) are both interest rate benchmarks, but they differ in significant ways.

1. Calculation Method:
   - LIBOR: LIBOR is based on the average interest rates at which a panel of major banks in London is willing to lend to each other in the wholesale, unsecured interbank market. It is calculated for multiple currencies and tenors.
   - SOFR: SOFR, on the other hand, is based on the overnight Treasury repurchase agreement (repo) market in the United States. It reflects the interest rate at which overnight loans are secured by U.S. Treasury securities.

2. Underlying Transactions:
   - LIBOR: LIBOR was historically based on interbank lending transactions that were largely unsecured. However, due to concerns about the reliability and liquidity of the underlying market, LIBOR is being phased out and will no longer be published after 2023.
   - SOFR: SOFR is based on a much larger and more robust market—the repo market—which involves the borrowing and lending of cash against high-quality collateral, primarily U.S. Treasury securities.

3. Risk Profile:
   - LIBOR: LIBOR is an unsecured rate, meaning it reflects the perceived credit risk between banks. It includes a premium for bank credit risk, as the rates are not guaranteed by collateral.
   - SOFR: SOFR, being based on secured transactions, is considered a risk-free rate. It represents the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasuries, removing the credit risk element.

4. Regulatory Oversight:
   - LIBOR: LIBOR was subject to manipulation scandals in the past, leading to a loss of confidence in its integrity. This prompted the need for a more robust benchmark and the decision to phase out LIBOR.
   - SOFR: SOFR is administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and is considered a more reliable and transparent benchmark due to its direct connection to observable market transactions.

5. Transition:
   - LIBOR: As mentioned earlier, LIBOR is being phased out by the end of 2023. Regulators and market participants are actively working on transitioning to alternative reference rates, such as SOFR.
   - SOFR: SOFR is the preferred alternative to LIBOR in the United States. Efforts are underway to develop derivatives and financial products that are tied to SOFR instead of LIBOR.

6. Forward Looking vs Backward Looking:
   - LIBOR: is a forward-looking interest rate benchmark. It is based on the average interest rates at which a panel of major banks in London expects to lend to each other in the future. LIBOR rates are typically quoted for various tenors (e.g., overnight, 1-month, 3-month, etc.), and they represent the market's expectation of borrowing costs over those specific periods.

   - SOFR: On the other hand, SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) is an overnight rate that is backward-looking. It reflects the actual interest rate at which overnight loans are secured by U.S. Treasury securities in the repo market. SOFR is calculated based on historical transaction data and is published the following business day, representing the observed rates from the previous day.

It's important to note that the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates, like SOFR, may have implications for financial contracts, loans, and other financial products that currently reference LIBOR. Market participants are advised to consult with their financial institutions and legal advisors to ensure a smooth transition and minimize any potential disruptions.
